Hi Gizem,

Thank you so much for the warm welcome! I am thrilled to be joining the team. Please accept my apologies for the slight delay in getting back to you.

I have gone through the onboarding steps you sent over and just had a few status updates and one quick question:

- **Sequoia Onboarding:** I am just about to complete this, but I have a question regarding the tax section. Could you let me know if Intenseye is a member of the **Employer Compensation Expense Program (ECEP)**? I need to confirm this to finish my tax elections.
    
- **Background Check:** I believe I have already completed the Checkr process. Could you please confirm if everything looks good on your end, or if there is a second step I might have missed?
    
- **NDA:** I have just signed the agreement via DocuSign.
    
- **Tangelo:** I have received the login details and will ensure all preboarding tasks are completed shortly.
    

I am super excited to join Intenseye and can't wait to get started on January 5th. I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone in the NY office!

Best regards,

Ivan
